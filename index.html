                    We do not admire the man of timid peace. We admire the man who embodies 
                    victorious effort; the man who never wrongs his neighbor, who is prompt to 
                    help a friend, but who has those virile qualities necessary to win in the 
                    stern strife of actual life. It is hard to fail, but it is worse never to have 
                    tried to succeed. In this life we get nothing save by effort. Freedom from 
                    effort in the present merely means that there has been stored up effort in the 
                    past. A man can be freed from the necessity of work only by the fact that he 
                    or his fathers before him have worked to good purpose. If the freedom thus 
                    purchased is used aright, and the man still does actual work, though of a 
                    different kind, whether as a writer or a General, whether in the field of 
                    politics or in the field of exploration and adventure, he shows he deserves 
                    his good fortune. But if he treats this period of freedom from the need of actual
                    labor as a period not of preparation, but of mere enjoyment, he shows that he is 
                    simply a cumberer of the earthâ€™s surface, and he surely unfits himself to hold his 
                    own with his fellows if the need to do so should again arise. A mere life of ease 
                    is not in the end a very satisfactory life, and, above all, it is a life which 
                    ultimately unfits those who follow it for serious work in the world.
